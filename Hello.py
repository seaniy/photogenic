        We are beyond thrilled to have you with us on our special day, whether in person or in spirit. This platform is designed for all of us to weave a tapestry of memories together. 

        **Here's how it works:**
        1. **Snap & Upload:** Capture those candid moments, those heartwarming smiles, or any memory you'd love to share.
        2. **Browse & Relive:** Flip through the gallery and see the wedding through the eyes of our loved ones.

        Every photo tells a story, and we can't wait to see the story you tell. Thank you for being a part of our journey and for sharing these moments with us.

        **With all our love,**  
        Sean & Carissa ‚ù§Ô∏è

        **Take Note: You may find the upload & gallery pages on the sidebar menu. If you do not see a sidebar menu, please click on the arrow at the top left of the page.**
